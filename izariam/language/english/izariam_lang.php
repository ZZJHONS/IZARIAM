$lang['army4_desc'] = 'Sword fighters are usually barely armoured and fight without shields to retain their mobility. Thus they can circulate around the immobile Phalanx formation and attack from the flanks.';

$lang['army10_desc'] = 'The mortar fires explosive shells against the walls of a besieged city. No building can withstand this destructiveness. However, the rare munition for it has to be brought along additionally, so shots fired need to be very well-targeted.';
$lang['army11_desc'] = 'A novel flying machine that is fast, versatile and not dependant on the direction of the wind - we can hunt cowardly enemies that want to attack us from the skies with it!';
$lang['army12_desc'] = 'Our inventors have discovered that the sun is so hot because it attracts warm air. That is why a balloon filled with hot air also rises in direction of the sun and our soldiers can throw explosive shells down on our enemies from up there.';
$lang['army13_desc'] = 'Your army`s cooks know exactly how to give new courage to the warriors and heroes in the encampment: A glass of wine and a stew, just like mum used to make! If they take the evening to remember what they are fighting for, enemies will find it very hard to wear them down.';

$lang['army19_desc'] = 'This ship contains a ballista, which was originally meant for firing grappling hooks. However, the ballista is also very valuable as a precise long-range combat weapon, as it hits the enemy under the waterline, even though it does not cause a large amount of damage.';
$lang['army20_desc'] = 'The catapult at the deck of the ship is smaller than its counterpart on land due to a lack of space. The ocean waves make it very imprecise, but it does fire clay jugs of burning oil, which leave dangerous little oil slicks behind at sea.';
$lang['army21_desc'] = 'The mortar ship has an especially large hull with a high water displacement, so that it can withstand the enormous recoil of the mortar. If the fuse of a missile is correctly measured, the powerful projectile explodes just over the enemy deck.';

Due to its steam engine, this ship can accelerate even more speedily and can therefore inflict a larger amount of damage on the enemy. The steam ram is probably the most dangerous ship at the front line.';
$lang['army25_desc'] = 'Thanks to our research, our scientists have managed to store large amounts of explosive power in wooden devices that can be blasted several hundred meters over the water`s surface and can cause a huge explosion if thrust on opposing ships.
